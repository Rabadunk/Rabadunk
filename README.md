  <p>I'm Jonathan â€” just your friendly neigbourhood software developer. I've been diving into code for 8 years and along the way, I've had a blast developing and creating different projects and tools. When I'm not in work mode, you'll find me running (you can see my strava stats below), snowboarding or reading a book. Right now, I'm jazzed about React Native, and I'm starting to use it to develop mobile apps for ios and android. Let's connect and swap stories! ðŸš€</p>

<p>Once upon a time, I whipped up this cool website that kept tabs on all the COVID-19 stats in New Zealand. Built with React to make things snazzy, Firebase to handle data like a pro, and Chart.js for some eye-catching charts. I even cooked up the data myself to make sure it was fresh and accurate. The goal was to give folks an easy way to stay in the loop about what was happening in New Zealand during the pandemic. It was a fun project, kind of like a digital hub to keep everyone in the know!
